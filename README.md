5. Levels of Measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales.
Statistical Inferences:
1. Population vs. Sample: Understanding the difference and the importance of representative sampling.
2. Central Limit Theorem: Explanation and demonstration of how sample means approximate a normal distribution.
3. Confidence Intervals: Calculating a range that likely contains the true population mean.
4. References for further
